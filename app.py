A clear plan for this project:
1. Allow users to upload images
2. run a CNN
3. Display prediction

3.1. additional pts
4. show eda via graphs, plots, df, etc.
5. read about marine protected areas (MPA)
6. implement a is_mpa() function that can take coordinates and 
if ship == detected and is_mpa:
    report to authorities 
7. add a page to explain what is the architecture and how is the app working.
